### **Proposal: Airdrop Distribution for Active Veritas Token Users**

**Overview:**

The purpose of this proposal is to incentivize and reward active members
of the Veritas community by distributing an airdrop of Veritas tokens. 
This initiative aims to foster community engagement, encourage participation 
and increase overall interest in the Veritas project.

**Objectives:**

- To reward users who have actively contributed to the growth of the Veritas community.
- To distribute tokens fairly among those who demonstrate consistent activity and support.
- To increase the circulation of Veritas tokens and broaden the token’s adoption within the community.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

To be eligible for the airdrop, users must meet one or more of the following criteria within a specified time frame
[the 17 days]:
1. **Participation in Governance:**
   - Active participation in governance voting or discussions on the Veritas platform.
2. **Content Creation and Sharing:**
   - Creation of original content (articles, videos, social media posts) that promotes Veritas.
   - Sharing Veritas-related content across social media platforms.
3. **Community Engagement:**
   - Active involvement in Veritas forums, Discord channels, or other official communication platforms.
   - Providing valuable feedback or suggestions for the project’s development.
4. **Token Holders:**
   - Holding a minimum 72,000 of Veritas tokens in a wallet for a specific duration.
5. **Referral Program:**
   - Successfully referring new users to the Veritas platform.

**Airdrop Allocation:**

The total airdrop pool will consist of [10]% of the max supply of Veritas token supply. 
The allocation will be distributed as follows:
- **[2.2]%** for users who have participated in governance activities.
- **[2]%** for content creators and promoters.
- **[2]%** for active community members.
- **[3]%** for long-term token holders.
- **[0.8]%** for users participating in the referral program.

**Distribution Mechanism:**

The airdrop distribution will be conducted as follows:
1. **Snapshot Date:** A snapshot of eligible users will be taken on [Specify Date]. 
Only users who meet the eligibility criteria by this date will be considered.
2. **Calculation of Allocation:** The allocation of tokens will be proportional to 
the level of activity demonstrated by each user. For example, users who have participated
in multiple activities may receive a larger portion of the airdrop.
3. **Airdrop Distribution Date:** The airdrop will be distributed to eligible users on 
[20th October 2024].

**Monitoring and Reporting:**

The Veritas team will monitor the distribution process and provide a report to the community 
after the airdrop is complete. This report will include the total number of tokens distributed, 
the number of eligible users, and any feedback received from the community.

**Conclusion:**

This airdrop proposal is designed to reward the loyalty and active participation of the Veritas community. 
By distributing tokens to those who have contributed to the project’s growth, we aim to build a stronger, 
more engaged community that will drive the success of Veritas.

We invite feedback from the community on this proposal and look forward to implementing a successful airdrop initiative.
